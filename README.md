This is a repository for a Web Application Development & Security final project revision. Our group, consisting of Dzi, Raissa, and Richie, aims to create a user-friendly platform that enables customers to browse and purchase products.

The project will leverage React JS to develop a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing the overall shopping experience. By utilizing SOA, we will ensure efficient communication between different services and components within the website, promoting scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

To achieve our objectives, we will employ various tools and techniques such as FAST API and CRUD operations. FAST API will be utilized to build robust and efficient APIs, while CRUD operations will enable seamless product and order management.

The final deliverable will be a fully functioning e-commerce website featuring essential features like a user-friendly interface, product browsing and search capabilities, secure payment options, shopping cart functionality, and order placement.
